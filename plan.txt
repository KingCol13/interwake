1. Client requests from server
2. Server sends random bytes (salt)
	or use diffie-hellman to get a salt? maybe in v2
	this prevents a listener brute forcing password once they know the salt, could just make password bigger?
3. Client concats authentication password and salt, hashes and sends
4. Server broadcasts WOL packet
5. Server sends confirmation, e.g: "Accepted."
